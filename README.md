# 10553527_WebScraper
Leveraging Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, this script scrapes academic articles from a university library's database for their authors' names, email addresses, and corresponding addresses. It makes us of try-except blocks, lists, DataFrames, and myriad functions of Selenium to achieve its aim.
This script was developed to replace the manual process of searching the database for names and copying and pasting them into a spreadsheet.
